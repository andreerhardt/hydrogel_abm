**Abstract:**  We derive a three-dimensional hydrogel model as a two-phase system of a fibre network and liquid solvent, where the
nonlinear elastic network accounts for the strain-stiffening properties typically encountered in biological gels. We use this
model to formulate free boundary value problems for a hydrogel layer that allows for swelling or contraction. We derive
two-dimensional plain-strain and plain-stress approximations for thick and thin layers respectively, that are subject to external
loads and serve as a minimal model for scaffolds for cell attachment and growth. For the collective evolution of the cells as
they mechanically interact with the hydrogel layer, we couple it to an agent-based model that also accounts for the traction
force exerted by each cell on the hydrogel sheet and other cells during migration. We develop a numerical algorithm for the
coupled system and present results on the influence of strain-stiffening, layer geometry, external load and solvent in/outflux
on the shape of the layers and on the cell patterns. In particular, we discuss alignment of cells and chain formation under
varying conditions.

**Dependencies:** Requires Python with legacy FEniCS 2019.1.0 and some standard libraries for plotting and data processing.

<h3>Hydrogel and cell coupling</h3>

Folder: `./abm_hydrogel`

Data: Generates data for Fig. 12,13,14,15,16 in the manuscript.

Usage: With each of the json files 

`run_elastic_NH_abm.json,run_elastic_NH_abm_plane_strain.json,run_hydro_NH_abm_AC.json,run_hydro_NH_stretched_AC_05.json,
run_hydro_gent_abm_AC.json,run_hydro_gent_abm_CH.json,run_hydro_gent_stretched_AC_05.json`

run the command 

`python3 main_ABM_Allen_Cahn_Hilliard.py JSONFILENAME.json`

to generate the corresponding data in an output folder. Then use the ... to generate the output.

<h3>ABM single and double cell interaction</h3>

Folder: `./abm_interaction`

Data: Generates data for Fig. 17,18,19 in the manuscript.

Usage: With each of the json files

`run_nh_hydro_stress_stretched.json,run_nh_strain.json,run_nh_strain_medpull.json,run_nh_strain_shortpull.json,run_nh_stress.json,
run_nh_stress_medpull.json,run_nh_stress_shortpull.json,run_nh_stress_stretched.json`

run 

`python3 main_interaction.py JSONFILENAME.json`

to generate the corresponding data or directly run the Linux `run0.sh` and `run1.sh` shell script. Similarly use 

`python3 main_plotter.py JSONFILENAME.json` and `python3 main_plotter_stretch.py JSONFILENAME.json` to generate the corresponding output files in the undeformed and deformed configuration, respectively.
