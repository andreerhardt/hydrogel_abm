**Abstract:**  We derive a three-dimensional hydrogel model as a two-phase system of a fibre network and liquid solvent, where the
nonlinear elastic network accounts for the strain-stiffening properties typically encountered in biological gels. We use this
model to formulate free boundary value problems for a hydrogel layer that allows for swelling or contraction. We derive
two-dimensional plain-strain and plain-stress approximations for thick and thin layers respectively, that are subject to external
loads and serve as a minimal model for scaffolds for cell attachment and growth. For the collective evolution of the cells as
they mechanically interact with the hydrogel layer, we couple it to an agent-based model that also accounts for the traction
force exerted by each cell on the hydrogel sheet and other cells during migration. We develop a numerical algorithm for the
coupled system and present results on the influence of strain-stiffening, layer geometry, external load and solvent in/outflux
on the shape of the layers and on the cell patterns. In particular, we discuss alignment of cells and chain formation under
varying conditions.

**Dependencies:** Requires Python with legacy FEniCS 2019.1.0 and some standard libraries for plotting and data processing.
